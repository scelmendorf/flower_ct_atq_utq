# Canopy height temperature in the ITEX plots at Barrow and Atqasuk, Alaska

## CONTENT
The data presented are the average hourly plant canopy temperature of plots (two-ten experiment open-top chamber plots and two-ten control plots) at four sites (Atqasuk Wet Meadow, Atqasuk Dry Heath, Barrow Wet Meadow, and Barrow Dry Heath).  Data were compiled from observations made from 1995-2019 in the plots.  Raw data are available at:

## DATA COLLECTION
Model 107 Temperature Probe were recorded on a CR10X Datalogger.  Temperatures were taken every 15 minutes averaged and recorded every hour.  Temperatures recorded with Onset HOBO and Stowaway were recorded every 10-20 minutes and were averaged each hour.  Details of the precision and accuracy of each recording device can be obtained from the manufacture.  Information on the equipment is provided below.

### Caveats
Data filtering was cursorily and not comprehensive.  Clearly the sensors provided some erroneous data and the most obvious of these data were removed.  


## DATA FORMAT
The following prefixes have been used to designate data type.
   str - indicates string (text) data
   num - indicates numeric data
All string data within a column contain the same number of characters.  


COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS  
strSite  - the site 1(B=Barrow Alaska, A=Atqasuk Alaska) 
strSitCom  - the site and community  
site 1(B=Barrow Alaska, A=Atqasuk Alaska) 
community 1(D=Dry Heath Tundra, W=Wet Meadow Tundra)  
strTrea  - treatment 1(C=Control, E=Open-Top Chamber) 
numYear  - the year of the recording (1998-2019)  
numJulian  - day of the year (1-366)  
numMonth  - month of the year (1-12)  
numHr  - hour of the day (0-23)  
numTp – average temperature at canopy height 13cm combining observations from Onset and Campbell data loggers.  Onset loggers were used in early years, after 2002 two plots of each treatment were equipped with temperature probes.  In the rare times when a sensor malfunctioned, values from a nearby location were used.  
numTempCa  - average temperature (oC) at canopy height 13cm using Onset Dataloggers in 2-10 plots  
numTemp13  - average temperature (oC) at canopy height 13cm using Campbell Model 107 Probe in 2 plots  

NOTE  
       -999.9 - indicates missing data
