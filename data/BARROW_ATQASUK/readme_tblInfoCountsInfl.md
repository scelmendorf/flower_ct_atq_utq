# Plant Inflorescence counts in the ITEX plots at Barrow and Atqasuk, Alaska

## CONTENT
The data presented are seasonal flowering (number of inflorescences in flower within a plot) collected weekly for all plant species during the summers of 1994-2019 for 48 plots (24 experiment open-top chamber plots and 24 control plots) at four sites (Atqasuk Wet Meadow, Atqasuk Dry Heath, Barrow Wet Meadow, and Barrow Dry Heath).
Please note that raw data for ongoing collections for these datasets (archived in a slightly different format) can be found at:

## DATA COLLECTION
Plant development was followed throughout the entire summer.  Plant measures were determined based on species morphology and ease of information collection.


### Caveats
Different data were collected in different years.  The data were quality checked, but the vast volume ensures that there are clearly some remaining errors.
